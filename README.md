# Birdsong-Recognition
To classify birds on basis of their species using their songs and audio processing techniques.

In the dataset found on kaggle, there 264 audio files. There are eactly 3 audio samples for each bird species. Hence I have selected first 10 species corresponding to 30 audio samples. The samples are renamed by the bird names, for the ease of understanding.

The audio samples are uploaded to the google drive (akshaykanive@gmail.com)
The link for the file is http://bit.ly/selected_audio
